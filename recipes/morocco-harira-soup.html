            <u>What Is <em>Moroccan Harira Soup?</em></u>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Harira is a traditional Moroccan soup of tomato, lentils, and
            chickpeas. Wonderfully fragrant with zesty seasoning, it often ranks
            high on lists of must-try Moroccan foods. It's a popular offering in
            Moroccan homes and restaurants, and you can even find it sold as
            street food.
        </p>

        <p>
            The name harira, derived from the Arabic word for silk, makes
            reference to the texture of the soup after it's been thickened with
            either eggs or a tedouira of flour and water. The tedouira
            (thickener) sometimes includes yeast and may be left to ferment for
            a day or two.

        <h3><u>INSTRUCTIONS</u></h3>
        <h4>Ahead of Time - Prep Ingredients</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Soak the chickpeas overnight. The next day, drain and peel them.
                This is easily done by pressing chickpeas one-by-one between
                your forefinger and thumb or by rubbing all of the chickpeas
                vigorously in a kitchen towel. (The prepped chickpeas may be be
                frozen until needed.)
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Pick through the lentils to remove any stones and debris; set
                aside until ready to use.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Stew the tomatoes then pass them through a food mill to make a
                puree; discard the skins and seeds. Or, cut the tomatoes into
                quarters and process them, with or without skin, in a food
                processor until smooth. (The pureed tomatoes may be frozen until
                needed.)
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Grate the onion or process it to a thick pulp in a food
                processor. (The grated onion may be mixed with the pureed
                tomatoes and frozen until needed.)
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Wash the celery and finely chop it. Set aside. Remove and
                discard large pieces of stem from the parsley and cilantro. Wash
                the parsley and cilantro and leave to drain thoroughly before
                chopping finely by hand or in a food processor. (The chopped
                herbs may be mixed together and frozen until needed.)
            </li>
            <br />
        </ol>

        <h4>Make The Soup</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a 6-quart or larger pressure cooker or stock pot, brown the
                meat in the oil over medium heat. Add the soup bones, peeled
                chickpeas, pureed tomatoes, grated onion, spices, smen (if
                using) and 3 cups (710 ml) of water. Bring to a boil, cover and
                cook with medium pressure for 25 minutes (or simmer for 50 to 60
                minutes).
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Add the lentils, tomato paste mixture, chopped herbs and 8.5
                cups (2 liters) water. Bring to a boil and cover. Continue to
                step 3 or step 4.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                If planning to add rice, cook the soup with medium pressure for
                30 minutes (or simmer for 60 minutes); add the rice, and
                continue cooking with pressure for another 15 minutes (or 30
                minutes by simmering).
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                <b>OR</b> if planning to add broken vermicelli, cook the soup
                with pressure for 45 minutes (or simmer for 90 minutes) before
                stirring in the broken vermicelli. Continue simmering for a few
                minutes until the vermicelli is tender.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Taste and adjust seasoning. Thicken the soup to a silky,
                cream-like consistency by gradually adding the tedouira (flour
                and water mixture), stirring constantly to ensure that it's well
                blended. Use only as much as is needed to make the soup as thick
                as you like.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Simmer the soup for another 5 to 10 minutes, stirring
                occasionally and skimming off any foam that forms on the
                surface.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>Remove from the heat and serve.</li>
            <br />
        </ol>

        <h3><u>NOTES</u></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A skin will form on the soup as it cools. This can be stirred
                and blended back into the soup.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                When reheating the soup, use medium or low heat and stir
                frequently to avoid lentils sticking to the bottom of the pot
                and burning.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                If you would like to freeze the soup, do so before adding the
                thickener and preferably before adding the rice or broken
                vermicelli. Allow it to cool completely before freezing. On the
                day of serving, thaw the soup over low heat then resume cooking
                from where you left off.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Cinnamon is optional and can be omitted. While many Moroccan
                cooks use it when making harira, not everyone likes it. On a
                personal note, I do prefer harira with a small amount of
                cinnamon as indicated in the recipe. It is very subtle and
                complementary to the overall flavor of the soup when used
                conservatively.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Lemon wedges may be served on the side for those who like a
                squeeze of fresh lemon juice as a condiment for the soup. If
                desired, garnish with a little fresh parsley or cilantro.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Blending the flour and water tedouira ahead of time will help
                ensure that it is lump-free when adding it to the soup.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                To make <b>gluten-free harira</b>, you can use cornstarch,
                tapioca starch, or another substitute for the flour to thicken
                the soup at the end of cooking.
            </li>
