            <h3>Shakshuka, pronounced <em>Shahk-SHOO-kah!</em></h3>
            <p>
                Shakshuka is a classic North African and Middle Eastern dish and
                one that's eaten for breakfast or any meal of the day. It's made
                from simple, healthy ingredients and is vegetarian.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shakshuka literally means “a mixture” and the traditional
                version uses tomatoes, onions and spices as the base with eggs
                poached on top.
            </p>

                <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon chili powder</li>

                <li>6 large eggs</li>

                <li>1 small bunch fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            </ul>
            <br />

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the
                    chopped bell pepper and onion and cook for 5 minutes or
                    until the onion becomes translucent.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>Add garlic and spices and cook an additional minute.</li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    Pour the can of tomatoes and juice into the pan and break
                    down the tomatoes using a large spoon. Season with salt and
                    pepper and bring the sauce to a simmer.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    Use your large spoon to make small wells in the sauce and
                    crack the eggs into each well. Cover the pan and cook for
                    5-8 minutes, or until the eggs are done to your liking.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>Garnish with chopped cilantro and parsley.</li>
