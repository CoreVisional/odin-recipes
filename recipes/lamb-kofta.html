        <h2>What Is <em>Turkish Lamb Kofta?</em></h2>
        <p>
            Koftas refers to a dish made with spiced ground meat (mince).
            Sometimes it's made on skewers (this recipe) though they do also
            come in non skewered form, often shaped like a torpedo / football.
        </p>

        <p>
            Typically, they are stuffed inside flatbreads with fresh salad or
            pickled vegetables and sauces, though they can be served over rice
            with fresh sides.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Yogurt Sauce</b>: Combine the yogurt sauce ingredients and
                leave in fridge for at least 20 mninutes for the flavor to
                develop (overnight even better!).
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                <b>Koftas</b>: Grate the onion into the bowl using a standard
                box grater. Add remaining Kofta ingredients and mix well with
                your hands.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                With damp hands, divide the meat into 8 equal pieces and push
                and shape the meat onto 8 skewers. Make them smooth (looks
                nicer, pictured!) or a bit nubbly (more surface area to brown!).
            </li>
            <br />
        </ol>

        <h4>COOKING</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Stove</b>: Preheat 1/2 tbsp oil in a large skillet over
                medium high heat. Cook in batches for 5 minutes in total,
                turning to brown evenly all over.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                <b>BBQ</b>: BBQ on medium high for about 6 minutes, rotating to
                brown all over.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                <b>Broiler/Oven Grill</b>: preheat and cook koftas 30cm/10" from
                heat source for 12 minutes, rotating as needed until lightly
                browned (you won't get as good a browning as stove/BBQ).
            </li>
            <br />
        </ol>

        <h4>SERVING</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Do a DIY spread - pile everything onto a platter a make everyone
                serve themselves.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Get a flatbread, smear with Yogurt Sauce, top with Red Cabbage
                Mint Salad (more options Note 3) then Kofta, drizzle over more
                Yoghurt Sauce. Devour and be happy!
