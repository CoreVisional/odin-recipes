        <h3>What Is <em>Menemen</em></h3>
        <p>
            Menemen is a traditional Turkish dish that is mostly served as a
            hearty breakfast. It is a simple one-pan dish with eggs, tomatoes
            and green peppers. This simple egg dish gets its name from a Turkish
            town called Menemen, which is located in Izmir. It is said that this
            egg dish was made first by the Cretan Turks who moved to this town.

        <br />

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a pan.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Cook chopped peppers in it for 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Add in tomatoes.</li>
            <br />
            <li>
                Season with salt and paprika and cook over medium low heat until
                tomatoes are tender, stirring occasionally. Now reduce the heat
                a bit.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>There are two options after this step:</li>
            <br />
            <ul style="list-style: none">
                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold">First Options: </span>In a
                    bowl, beat the eggs and pour it all over the tomatoes. Give
                    it a gentle stir so that the beaten eggs can spread
                    everywhere. Cook it uncovered until the eggs are set. It
                    takes no longer than 3-5 minutes. Don't overcook.
                </li>

                <br />

                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold">Second Options: </span>
                    Using a spoon, make rooms for each egg and break eggs into
                    those hollows. Let it simmer uncovered until the eggs are
                    slightly cooked for 8-10 minutes. Help egg whites cook well
                    with a spoon. If you like the yolks hard, cook longer.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br />
            <li>
                Sprinkle black pepper and red pepper flakes over it. Garnish
                with herbs like parsley or chopped green onions and serve.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>Serve it with your favorite crusty bread.</li>
