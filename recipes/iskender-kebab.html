            <h3>What Is Iskender Kebap</h3>
            <p>
                Iskender kebab is just another traditional Turkish way of serving
                döner. This dish mainly consists of döner meat which is made from
                thinly sliced and cooked ground lamb or beef. This meat is unique in
                and of itself as it gets cooked vertically. It is served on top of
                pide bread and tomato sauce, accompanied by yogurt and topped with
                extra tomato sauce and browned melted butter.

            <h3>Meaning of <em>Iskender</em></h3>
            <p>
                Iskender kebab, or sometimes referred to as Bursa kebab, is named
                after the founder of this mouth-watering dish, Iskender Efendi. His
                family owned and operated a restaurant when Iskender suggested
                baking meat vertically. Ever since 1867 this dish has only increased
                in popularity and has achieved fame across the globe!

            <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <h4>Doner Meat:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Puree the onion in a food processor. Sieve its juice into a
                    large mixing bowl. We just need the juice.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    Put the ground beef, döner kebab seasoning, salt, yogurt and
                    milk in the same bowl. Combine them well using your hand. Give
                    it a log shape.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>Transfer it on a baking paper and wrap it tightly.</li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    Let it rest in the fridge for 2 hours. Then transfer it to the
                    freezer and let it sit there for 8 hours or overnight. You can
                    remove it from the freezer when you are ready to cook.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br />

            <h4>Tomato Sauce:</h4>
            <p>
                Melt butter in a saucepan. Add in tomato paste and tomato
                juice/puree or passata. Pour water over these. Add in salt and
                pepper and cook over medium heat until it boils. Reduce the heat to
                the lowest and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>Cooking Doner:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    While your sauce is simmering, you can cook the doner. Remove it
                    from the freezer and let it sit on the counter for 5-10 minutes.
                    Hold the döner log with a piece of baking paper and carefully
                    make large thin slices (like shaving) using a sharp knife.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    Heat one teaspoon butter in a non stick pan over high heat. Line
                    sliced döner pieces in a single layer and cook both sides until
                    nicely brown.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    Cook döner in batches and never overload the pan. You can
                    transfer the cooked pieces on a plate and finally put them all
                    the pan just to heat a bit right before serving.
                </li>
                <br />
            </ol>
            <br />

            <h4>Heating Pide Bread:</h4>
            <p>
                While you are cooking the doner, you can heat chopped pide bread in
                a pan with a splash of water. We want them soft, so you can add a
                little more water if needed.
            </p>
            <br />

            <h4>Assemble The Kebab:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Place heated pide bread chunks on a plate.</li>
                <br />
                <li>Drizzle a little tomato sauce over them.</li>
                <br />
                <li>Top it with cooked doner meat (as much as you want).</li>
                <br />
                <li>Pour a generous amount of tomato sauce over meat.</li>
                <br />
                <li>
                    Place a dollop of yogurt, roasted or raw tomatoes and green
                    peppers on the side of the meat on the same plate.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>Drizzle sizzling butter over these and serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
            <br />
