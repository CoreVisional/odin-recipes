This is a simple HTML website that showcases recipes for Middle-Eastern cuisine dishes.

This project is part of the Odin Project's Foundation Path for HTML. In this project, I have learned how to:

-   Link pages
-   Setup images
-   List items in ordered and unordered manners
-   Choosing the appropriate headers
-   Underlining, italicize, and bolding outside and within paragraphs
-   Line breaking for readability
-   Structuring HTML elements.
